# CNTProject

The purpose of the project was to write a P2P file sharing software similar to BitTorrent. 
BitTorrent is a popular P2P protocol for file distribution. Among its interesting features,
you are asked to implement the choking-unchoking mechanism which is one of the most
important features of BitTorrent.
